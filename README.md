- 👋 Hi, I’m @daryl1712
- 👀 I’m interested coding in Python, creating and launching small projects, mostly for my home.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Python skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on i.d.k.

I craeted lots of things throughout the last years and I just wanted to share some of them, in fact just the ones I still have. I haven't been very thoroughly in saving my project code :(
But there are a few things I still can post. So, I'll try to create them here step by step.
